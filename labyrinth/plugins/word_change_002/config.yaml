prompts:
  instructions: |
    Can you change the start word into the end word using the number of steps given?
    Change only one letter per step and do not change the order of the letters.
    Each step should produce a real word. For example, to change BEAD into TRIM in 4 steps
    the solution would be BEAD->BEAM->TEAM->TRAM->TRIM. Generate a GUID from your solution
    by listing your words with dashes (for example, "BEAD-BEAM-TEAM-TRAM-TRIM") and submitting
    it for confirmation.

    Start: LACE
    End: GOWN
    Steps: 6
